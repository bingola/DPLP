MainRunFile.m--- Main run file.  
preprocess_networks_func--- Take input as network dataset, compute query set Q
SampleGraph_func--- Take graph as input ansd sample 85\% nbr and non-neighbor for each query in Q
ComputeScoresNonDeep_func-- Compute s_A(u,v) for triad based LP algo, like 'CN','AA','JC','CRW'.
ComputeScoresDeep_func-- Compute s_A(u,v) for triad based LP algo, like 'nodetovec','structtovec','PRUNE','line'.
DpAllTriad_func--- For ('CN','AA','JC','CRW'), Execute all DP algorithms (DPLP, Lapl., Gauss., and Exp. and store MAP values with statistics)
DpAllDeep_func--- For ('nodetovec','structtovec','PRUNE','line'), Execute all DP algorithms (DPLP, Lapl., Gauss., and Exp. and store MAP values with statistics)

CreatePrivacyVsMAP--- stores all results. Run this file_ONLY_AFTER_ALL_REULTS else can show error. This  
GenerateTable-- generate table 1
plotFigure1_func--Plot Figure 1: MAP vs PRIVACY for all datasets for triad based LPs.
plotFigure2_func--Plot Figure 2: MAP vs PRIVACY for all baselines for Yeast across all LPs. 

ComputeAcc--functions for AUC and MAP, we only compute MAP
laplace_rand--laplace random number generation.
